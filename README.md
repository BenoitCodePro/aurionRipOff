# aurionRipOff

The goal of this java project is to recreate (through a command line software) the behavior of the aurion website.

The supported features are:
1. Add student/teacher into the list of existing persons
2. Save the list by serializing it
3. Load a list by deserializing a file

## We are working on a feature that allows you to use your RFID card to display your information

This feature will use an Arduino which will communicate through USB (serial port) with the java software.
More information will come.
